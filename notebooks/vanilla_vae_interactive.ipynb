    "### üéØ What you can do with this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîÑ Reconstruct images**: Use the interactive widget to see how well your VAE reconstructs real medical images\n",
    "2. **üé® Generate new images**: Sample from the latent space to create entirely new synthetic medical images  \n",
    "3. **üîÄ Explore latent space**: Interpolate between images to understand the learned representations\n",
    "4. **üìä Analyze performance**: View reconstruction metrics like MSE, PSNR, and SSIM\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Tips for better results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load trained weights**: Update the checkpoint path in the model loading section to use your trained model\n",
    "- **Try different seeds**: Use the randomize option to explore diverse generations\n",
    "- **Experiment with interpolation**: Choose different image pairs to see interesting transitions\n",
    "- **Monitor metrics**: Lower MSE and higher PSNR/SSIM indicate better reconstructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Customization options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change `dataset_name` to \"pneumoniamnist\" for different medical images\n",
    "- Modify `MODEL_CONFIG` to match your trained model architecture\n",
    "- Adjust `batch_size` and `num_samples` based on your system capabilities\n",
